- https://wuct.clive.io/ shows the live scoreboard.
- https://wuct.clive.io/scoring.html shows the scoring station interface. This is intended to be used for multiple scoring stations throughout the competition venue where teams can drop off question packets. Each scoring station should handle multiple teams, and each team should be assigned to a single station.
- https://wuct.clive.io/control.html shows the control panel. This is intended to be the central control for everything.

Based off of the Lexington Math Tournament Guts Round, which is in turn based off of the HMMT Guts Round.
